This is a .NET console application that generates Latin Squares
for any given set of symbols (e.g., numbers). Latin Squares have
applications in mathematics for optimization purposes.

You can read more about Latin Squares on Wikipedia:

The task of generating all squares for a set of symbols can
become a very expensive operation for higher number of symbols
(numbers), so this implementation takes advantage of several
techniques to optimize the process, however, the generation
may still take minutes or hours to complete for higher orders.

This implementation has the best and most efficient algorithm
as far as I know, and uses several techniques to make the
generation process faster and more efficient.

This project was started by Keyvan Nayyeri and received some
invaluable additions from Scott Gartner.

The implementation is described in details on my blog:
